   April is the cruellest month, breeding
   Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing
   Memory and desire, stirring
   Dull roots with spring rain.
   Winter kept us warm, covering
   Earth in forgetful snow, feeding
   A little life with dried tubers.
   Summer surprised us, coming over the<button id="myButton4">Starnbergersee</button>
   With a shower of rain; we stopped in the colonnade,
   And went on in sunlight, into the<button id="myButton5">Hofgarten,</button><div class="line-number">10</div> 
   And drank coffee, and talked for an hour.
  <button id="myButton6">Bin gar kine Russin, stamm' aus Litauen, echt deutsch.</button>
   And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
   My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
   And I was frightened. He said, Marie, 
   Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
   In the mountains, there you feel free.
   I read, much of the night, and go south in the winter.
   
      What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
   Out of this stony rubbish? <button id="myButton7">Son of man,</button><div class="line-number">20</div>

   A heap of broken images, where the sun beats,

   And the dry stone no sound of water. Only
   There is shadow under this red rock, 
   (Come in under the shadow of this red rock),

   Your shadow at morning striding behind you
   Or your shadow at evening rising to meet you;

   (Another hid his eyes behind his wing)
   Doubled the flames of seven branched candelabra
   Reflecting light upon the table as
   The glitter of her jewels rose to meet it,
   From satin cases poured in rich profusion;
   In vials of ivory and coloured glass
   Unstoppered, lurked her strange synthetic perfumes,
   Unguent, powdered, or liquid—troubled, confused
   And drowned the sense in odours; stirred by the air
   That freshened from the window, these ascended<div class="line-number">90</div>

   Flung their smoke into the<button id="myButton25">laquearia,</button>

   Huge sea-wood-fed with copper
   Burned green and orange, framed by the coloured stone,

   Were told upon the walls; staring forms
   Leaned out, leaning, hushing the room enclosed.

   Under the firelight, under the brush, her hair

      When Lil's husband got demobbed, I said—
   I didn't mince my words, I said to her myself,<div class="line-number">140</div>
   HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
   Now Albert's coming back, make yourself a bit smart.
   He'll want to know what you done with that money he gave you
   To get yourself some teeth. He did, I was there.
   You have them all out, Lil, and get a nice set,
   He said, I swear, I can't bear to look at you.
   And no more can't I, I said, and think of poor Albert,
   He's been in the army four years, he wants a good time,
   And if you don't give it him, there's others will, I said.
   Oh is there, she said. Something o' that, I said.<div class="line-number">150</div>
   Then I'll know who to thank, she said, and give me a straight look.
   HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
   If you don't like it you can get on with it, I said,
   Others can pick and choose if you can't.
   But if Albert makes off, it won't be for lack of telling.
   You ought to be ashamed, I said, to look so antique.
   (And her only thirty-one.)
   I can't help it, she said, pulling a long face,
   It's them pills I took, to bring it off, she said.
   (She's had five already, and nearly died of young George.)<div class="line-number">160</div>
   The chemist said it would be alright, but I've never been the same.
   You <i>are</i> a proper fool, I said.
   Well, if Albert won't leave you alone, there it is, I said,
   What you get married for if you don't want children?
   HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME
   Well, that Sunday Albert was home, they had a hot gammon,
   And they asked me in to dinner, to get the beauty of it hot—

   The river's tent is broken: the last fingers of leaf
   Clutch and sink into the wet bank. The wind
   Crosses the brown land, unheard. The nymphs are departed.
  <button id="myButton34">Sweet Thames, run softly, till I end my song.</button>
   The river bears no empty bottles, sandwich papers,
   Silk handkerchiefs, cardboard boxes, cigarette ends
   Or other testimony of summer nights. The nymphs are departed.
   And their friends, the loitering heirs of city directors;<div class="line-number">180</div>

   The rattle of the bones, and chuckle spread from ear to ear.
   A rat crept softly through the vegetation
   Dragging its slimy belly on the bank
   While I was fishing in the dull canal
   On a winter evening round behind the gashouse<div class="line-number">190</div>
   Musing upon the king my brother's wreck
  <button id="myButton37">And on the king my father's death before him.</button>
   White bodies naked on the low damp ground
   And bones cast in a little low dry garret,
   Rattled by the rat's foot only, year to year.

   Asked me in demotic French
   To luncheon at the Cannon Street Hotel
   Followed by a weekend at the Metropole.

   Stockings, slippers, camisoles, and stays.

   He, the young man carbuncular, arrives,
   A small house agent's clerk, with one bold stare,
   One of the low on whom assurance sits
   As a silk hat on a Bradford millionaire,
   The time is now propitious, as he guesses,
   The meal is ended, she is bored and tired,
   Endeavours to engage her in caresses
   Which still are unreproved, if undesired.
   Flushed and decided, he assaults at once;
   Exploring hands encounter no defence;<div class="line-number">240</div>
   His vanity requires no response,
   And makes a welcome of indifference.

   IV. <em>Death by Water</em>
   
   Phlebas the Phoenician, a fortnight dead,
   Forgot the cry of gulls, and the deep sea swell
   And the profit and loss.
                                      A current under sea
   Picked his bones in whispers. As he rose and fell
   He passed the stages of his age and youth
   Entering the whirlpool.
                                    Gentile or Jew
   O you who turn the wheel and look to windward,<div class="line-number">320</div>
